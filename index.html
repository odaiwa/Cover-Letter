                at your company. I believe I would be an excellent fit for this position since I am a full developer <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                I tend to view myself as a generalist since I try not to focus on any given technology. <br>
                My skills range from <b> C, C++ to C#, Javascript and Typescript .</b> Some of Frameworks i worked on <b> React, Angular 12, NodeJs, .Net</b>. I have been exposed to a wide variety of
                technologies in my career and consider myself to be very adaptable.
